Geog592 - Lab2
Lab2 is due in one week before class.

Please create a "submission" folder in your onyen folder and copy your completed lab2 folder to it. (1 Point)
4 Points for each question below.


(1) In q1.py, please ask a user to input the radius value for a circle, then prompt the user with its area and perimeter values.

(2) In q2.py, please ask a user to input a list of numbers, separated by space, then prompt the user with the average, median, sum of the list, and also output a sorted list. You are not allowed to use any modules (such as numpy) to complete this question.

(3) In q3.py, please find NC2010.txt in lab2 folder first, then calculate the population change for each county from 2000-2010, and output the result to a textfile ( ncpopchg.txt).
You could use this output format -
CountyName, PopChg%
....
Orange, 21.11%
Durham, 17.12%
...
An example of writing to a text file:
	f = open("temp.txt", "w")
	f.write("How are you?")
	f.writelines(lines)
	f.close()

(4) In q4.py, please modify q3.py, so you can output a sorted county list, based on populate change from 2000-2010, save the output to ncpopchgSorted.txt.

(5) Given two list of coordinates -
list1 =[(10,20),(25,8),(34,22),(17,35),(9,1),(31,20),(44,11)]
list2 = [(1,21),(19,22),(23,12),(51,26),(78,61),(41,17),(11,21),(81,10),(79,51)]
In your q5.py, please find the mean center of both point lists and output the value; please find the average distance between a point in list1 and a point in list2.

(6) p6.py: Please find two text files in lab2 folder. Cities.txt contains a list of cities, along with their SPC(FEET) coordinate values. Locations.txt contains a list of candidate locations, along with their coordinate values (Also in SPC FEET). The rule for selecting the best location for a regional human resource department is simple ¨C the location which has the minimum distance from all cities. Write a python script to find out the best location. Please output (a) best location id (b) its average distance (in miles) from all cities.

Example of reading text files:
f1 = open("lab2.txt", "r")
list2 = f1.readline()
print list2
f1.close()
