Lab 7 is due on April 4, before class.
In lab7 folder, you can find the county population file for USA from 1930 - 2000.
In demographics, the rank mobility index (RMI) is a measure of an area's change in 
population rank among a group of areas.
Formally
(R1-R2)/(R1+R2)
where
R1 = area's population rank at time 1
R2 = area's population rank at time 2
A RMI value must be between âˆ’1 and 1. A RMI of 0 indicates no change.
A positive RMI indicates increase in RANK. A change in higher rank carries more weight.

Please design a Python Tool to carry the RMI analysis.
The basic rank tool design (25 Points)
1) The user selects the input dataset
2) Then the user selects an numerical field to rank
3) The user also defines (types) the name of the new field

Your tool will create a new Rank field (with the name defined by the user) and assign the correct
rank value to the field (1,2, ...)

Bonus (Extra 10 Points)
The design of a Python Tool to compute the complete RMI analysis:
1) Select the input dataset
2) Select a State
3) Choose two different years (for example, 1980 and 2000)
4) Name the RMI field
Your python tool will create an output feature class for the chosen state with RMI values
