Lab6 - Customizing your python scripts and use them as tools in ArcGIS. Please create a python toolbox as "Lab5.pyt" and copy it to the submission folder once complete. 
Lab6 is due on March 28,2023,before class.


(1) Convert lab1-1 question as a tool (healthMonitor) and store it in your python toolbox (Lab6.pyt)

Please make sure the input values from users are valid (no negative values)
Design a python script (q1.py) to diagnose if a person is overweight or underweight, using weight (pound) and height (feet). Using the following formulas:
- Underweight: weight<sw*0.9
- Normal Weight: sw*0.9<=weight<=sw*1.1
- Overweight: sw*1.1<weight<=sw*1.2
- Class I Obesity: sw*1.2<weight<=sw*1.3
- Class II Obesity: sw*1.3<weight<=sw*1.4
- Class III Obesity: sw*1.4<weight


(2) Convert lab1-3 question as a tool (degreeConvertor) and store it in your python toolbox (Lab6.pyt)

Write a script to convert dd:mm:ss degree (from users¡¯ input) to decimal degree, and prompt the results to users. Note ¨C please advise users the input format (20:30:40), otherwise you will have hard time to interpret the input.

(3) Convert lab 2-6 question as a tool (bestLocation) and store it in your python toolbox (Lab6.pyt)

Please find two text files in lab2 folder. Cities.txt contains a list of cities, along with their SPC(FEET) coordinate values. Locations.txt contains a list of candidate locations, along with their coordinate values (Also in SPC FEET). The rule for selecting the best location for a regional human resource department is simple ¨C the location which has the minimum distance from all cities. Write a python script to find out the best location. Please output (a) best location id (b) its average distance (in miles) from all cities.

(4) Convert lab 3-3 question as a tool (highwayAnalysis) and store it in your python toolbox (Lab6.pyt).
Please convert your model to python script, and allow a user to specify two Interstates (such as I40 and I80), a buffer distance (such as 30, 45, or 60), and a numerical field, then your script will output two summarized values for selected cities and selected fields (one for each interstate highway).

(5) Convert lab5 question as a tool (suitability analysis) and store it in your python toolbox (Lab6.pyt).
Your suibability analysis tool allows a user to configure weights for slope, land use and distance to stream.
